# 🚀 Space Shooter – PyGame  

A simple 2D space shooter game built with Python and the PyGame library.  

## 🎮 Gameplay Features  
- 🛸 **Player Controls** – Move around and shoot lasers to destroy meteors  
- ☄️ **Meteors** – Randomly spawn and fall towards the player  
- 💥 **Explosions** – Animated explosion effects when meteors are destroyed  
- 🎵 **Sound Effects & Music** – Laser shots, explosions, and background music  
- 📈 **Score Tracking** – Displays survival time  

## 🕹️ Controls  
- **W** / **A** / **S** / **D** → Move Up / Left / Down / Right  
- **SPACE** → Shoot lasers  

## 🎯 About This Project  
I built this project to gain a better understanding of how games work under the hood and to explore the fundamentals of game
development. It follows the tutorial from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs&t=14444s&ab_channel=ClearCode) 
by Clear Code, which provides a great introduction to PyGame and game mechanics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **PyGame** – Game development library  

## 🚀 What I Learned  
✔️ **Handling complex data structures** – Working with objects, lists, and dictionaries efficiently  
✔️ **Event-driven programming** – Managing user input and system events dynamically  
✔️ **Optimizing performance** – Understanding frame rates, loops, and real-time updates  
✔️ **Working with external assets** – Loading and handling images, sounds, and fonts  
✔️ **Collision detection and spatial logic** – Managing object interactions and movement  
✔️ **Structuring larger projects** – Organizing code into reusable and maintainable components
